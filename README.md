<h2 align='center'>Information - OneSync Infinity</h2>

The ultimate purpose of the tracker is to connect groups of players together. Be it criminal, government or otherwise. Using the item the player is able to join, create or delete their group.

Group names can be reserved for jobs, for e.g. there may be a gang on your server called Lost MC. Using the config you can set this as a “reserved” gang, meaning that these gang members (based on their ESX Job) can only join one group - lostmc, and also means that people who are not part of the job are unable to join. Furthermore, using the config you can set “parent” group names. This is useful for the emergency services, for example having the Police and the Ambulance (medics) assigned to the parent “emergency”.

So long as the player has the tracker item in their inventory they will continue to see all the other members of their group. If however, they drop the tracker or lose it by being stolen / death they will be removed from the group after a period of time (set in the config).

Using the tracker tag you’re able to punish criminals in a different way than just sending them to jail. For as long as they are tagged they will be tracked by the government (jobs defined in the config).
